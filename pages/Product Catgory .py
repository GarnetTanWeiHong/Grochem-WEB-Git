To address the ‚Äúmissing puzzle‚Äù of machine learning, which is the annotated printed circuit board, a pre-label approach is introduced. The labelling cost in PCBs area is relatively higher than other industries as there are required more professionals to identify. A pre-label approach has reduced the needs of professionals, and simplified the job of product owner by scanning through the result of pre-labeling, instead of manually labelling. A pre-label approach is completed via two steps. 

First, we start by manually labelling a small portion of the dataset, followed by training a model. In our experience, our team used 60~100 pcs of annotated images to train on YOLOv8-seg. The accuracy(mAP) varies from 93% to 98%. By implementing the simple model, we can annotate the remaining dataset with the simple model, and thus go through the result, validate the correctness of annotation, and adjust accordingly. 

Besides, in order to ensure the performance of a simple model on the unlabelled dataset, we can limit the number of predicted classes per entry, and adjust the confidence level, and even the Intersection of Union(IoU) to prevent overlapping. Not only that, image augmentation is also essential in this pre-labelled approach, as it can produce more training dataset in terms of multiplying. 

As the YOLOv8 is used and the Mosaic augmentation techniques are applied to YOLOv8 as well, it decreases the needs of large annotated dataset to reach the industry standard.

As the pixel by pixel approach performance results in a high false-positive rate, we introduced the deep learning approach. In order to prove to the industry that our deep learning model actually meets their requirements, a series of testing has been designed as a benchmark. 

Depending on the usage of object detection in other aspects, for example object tracking is more concerned on the mean average precision (mAP), as it could accept a false positive, and thus these false positives are handled when there is re-processing the data retrieved, by ignoring them. This approach is not applicable to the PCB manufacturing industry as the high volume of production, wastage of resources and in terms of cost effectiveness. In order to address that, we are not aiming to achieve high mAP, instead we aim to train a model that could pass the good unit test and over reject test. To train such a model, a series of null images is passed into the model, to better ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù the targeting pattern that they should capture. A comparison on the same pre-trained model with and without null class is shown in the next section. 

Different from traditional models which aim to detect everything, by mixing the null class, it could more accurately capture, and reduce the false positives when only one class is inputted. Followed by the multiple classes annotation, the null class is actually impacting in reducing the false positives as well as the null class is a good one without any detection. Therefore, it trained the model to recognize such conditions should not be classified as defect.
